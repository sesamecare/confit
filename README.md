# confit

@sesamecare-oss/confit is a modern rewrite of [confit](https://github.com/krakenjs/confit) in Typescript using Promises and bundling the standard shortstop handlers. The general approach of stackable environment-aware configurations is retained, but we add proper typing for key lookups and just generally modernize the build pipeline.
